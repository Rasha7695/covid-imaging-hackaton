The family denied history of fever or cough, but reported that the patient has been falling frequently in the past week. The patient was intubated for airway protection and a code stroke was activated. Vital signs in the ED were significant for Temp of 100.2? F (37.9? C), HR 101, BP 130/77, Examination was significant for left hemiplegia and aphasia. NIHSS was calculated to be 36. CT head revealed an acute right MCA stroke (Fig. 3a). CTA of the head and neck demonstrated occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at origin and incidental bilateral patchy apical lung opacities (Fig. 3b). CT perfusion demonstrated a 305 cc core infarct in the right MCA distribution and a surrounding 109 cc ischemic penumbra (Fig. 3c). The patient was deemed not a suitable candidate for any acute neuro-intervention due to the large core infarct. Considering these characteristic CT findings, the patient was tested for COVID-19 infection with PCR and was positive. Laboratory data on admission demonstrated leukocytosis with lymphopenia, elevated d-dimer (13966 ng/ml DDU), along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (712 U/L) and elevated C ? reactive protein (16.24 mg/dl). The patient?s hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury and progressively increasing oxygen requirements.

Her eGFR was 45 to 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2. She was maintained on tacrolimus with levels between 5 and 8 ng/ml, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg twice a day (BD), and prednisolone 5 mg OD. Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 ? 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 ?mol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis).
